## angular2-tutorial

This repo show the progress of
[tutorial of Angular2](https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/), including:

* [Quickstart](https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/quickstart.html)
* [Tour of heroes](https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/tutorial/)

After complete the whole tutorial, I will add some advance steps, including:

* use [TSlint][tslint] for semantic and syntactic checks
* use [gulp][gulp] for complex builds
* some tips for running by other web server(such as nginx)

**IMPORTANT NOTE**: Since many libraries was changed very fast, I use the lastest
version of Angular2(V2.0.0-beta.11), but some part of the library may be changed
in the future, so the code in this repo maybe out of date.
